# Functionality Decision Log - Lee Hill Labs / ECA

## Purpose

This log captures product behavior, logic, data needs, and user-story seeds discovered while shaping the Lee Hill Labs presentation. It is meant to transfer presentation decisions into the future ECA app development plan.

## Capture Keyword

Use `devlog` when a presentation discussion creates a functional product rule.

When `devlog` appears, capture the decision here, organize it by feature area, and convert it into planning-ready notes:

- Product rule: what must be true in the app
- User story seed: who needs it and why
- Data / logic notes: fields, state, permissions, or workflows implied
- Open questions: unresolved assumptions before build
- Source: slide, conversation context, or related mock screen

## Feature Areas

- Incident dashboard

- Household profile
- Requests and tasks
- Emergency text feed
- Map, routes, and hazard perimeter
- Check-ins and safety status
- Offline plan
- Partner / civic view
- Onboarding and groups

## Decisions

### 2026-05-01 - App Placeholder Naming

- Product rule: Use `ECA` as the in-app placeholder name until the final product name is chosen.
- User story seed: As a deck reviewer, I need consistent app naming so product screens feel like one coherent system.
- Data / logic notes: Keep `ECA` easy to find/replace in UI copy and documentation.
- Open questions: Final app name and shorthand.
- Source: App screen mockups, docs/memory find/replace notes.

### 2026-05-01 - Demo Community

- Product rule: Use `Boulder Heights` as the current demo community in app mockups.
- User story seed: As an emergency partner or local group admin, I need the app scoped to a recognizable community so coordination context is clear.
- Data / logic notes: Community name should be configurable per group or deployment.
- Open questions: Final first-test geography or UAT community.
- Source: Slide 5 and slide 9 app screens.

### 2026-05-01 - Incident Dashboard

- Product rule: The dashboard should foreground the active incident, check-in count, urgent requests, emergency feed, safety action, and offline plan readiness.
- User story seed: As a household member during an incident, I need one screen that tells me what is happening, whether my group is accounted for, what is needed, and how to report my status quickly.
- Data / logic notes: Requires incident name/status, group check-in counts, request count, emergency feed items, user safety status, and offline cache state.
- Open questions: Who can publish emergency feed items, and how are official vs community updates distinguished?
- Source: Slide 5 dashboard mockup.

### 2026-05-01 - Group Coordination

- Product rule: Group coordination should combine incident context, chat/action access, urgent request count, and emergency news updates.
- User story seed: As a group member, I need urgent requests and emergency updates separated from general conversation so action items do not get buried.
- Data / logic notes: Requests should be countable and status-based; news updates may need source labels, timestamps, and priority levels.
- Open questions: Whether `Group chat` is a full chat surface, a filtered coordination thread, or a button into chat.
- Source: Slide 9 screen 2.

### 2026-05-01 - Household Profile

- Product rule: A household profile should store emergency-relevant details: address, door code, animal locations, and supplies.
- User story seed: As a trusted group member helping during an evacuation, I need authorized household details so I can assist quickly without searching old messages.
- Data / logic notes: Sensitive fields require explicit permissions, access logging, and incident-mode visibility rules.
- Open questions: Which fields are always visible, incident-only, or hidden unless shared with specific trusted contacts?
- Source: Slide 9 `My Household` screen.

### 2026-05-01 - Open Requests

- Product rule: Requests should be concrete, urgent, and written as needs such as `Horse Trailer`, `Jumper Cables`, and `Dogs in house`.
- User story seed: As a neighbor or emergency partner, I need a clear request list so I can volunteer help or route the need to someone who can act.
- Data / logic notes: Requests need type, urgency, requester, location/household association, status, assignee, and resolution state.
- Open questions: Whether requests can be created by households, coordinators, emergency partners, or all group members.
- Source: Slide 9 screen 5.

### 2026-05-01 - Tasks vs Requests vs Answered Requests

- Product rule: Separate pre-evacuation `tasks` from help `requests` and `answered requests` so users do not confuse private/checklist work with group help coordination.
- User story seed: As a user who needs more horse trailers than I have access to, I need to post a request to my group so a neighbor can answer it, assign themselves, and make the group aware that the need is covered.
- Data / logic notes: Requests need lifecycle states such as open, answered, assigned, en route, arrived, completed, and canceled. Answered requests need responder identity, assignment status, ETA/location sharing state, and notification trail.
- Data / logic notes: Tasks can remain checklist-style items to complete before evacuating, such as closing vents, loading supplies, or checking animals. Requests are social/coordination objects that invite another person to respond.
- Data / logic notes: Answered requests may trigger notification strings based on GPS or geofencing, including responder en route, responder nearby, responder arrived, household departed, or request completed.
- Open questions: What location-sharing permissions are required for responders, requesters, and coordinators? Should geofence updates be automatic, manually confirmed, or both?
- Source: `devlog` discussion on request/assignment semantics.

### 2026-05-01 - Preparedness Drills and Certification

- Product rule: Add a later-state preparedness section for drills, mock evacuations, and neighbor readiness practice.
- User story seed: As a community organizer or emergency partner, I need to run mock evacuations with neighbors so the group can practice roles, routes, requests, check-ins, and offline plans before a real incident.
- Data / logic notes: Drill mode should simulate incidents without sending real emergency alerts. It may need templates, scheduled drills, participant status, completion metrics, after-action notes, and improvement tasks.
- Data / logic notes: Preparedness progress could support certification concepts such as FireSafe Certified or lower readiness levels that may be useful for civic partners, insurers, HOAs, or community programs.
- Open questions: Who can create certification criteria, and what evidence would be required for insurance discounts or formal readiness recognition?
- Open questions: Should certifications belong to households, groups, neighborhoods, or partner organizations?
- Source: `devlog` discussion on preparedness and mock evacuation feature planning.

### 2026-05-01 - Map Context

- Product rule: Map states should show evacuation routes and hazard perimeter while avoiding claims of official precision.
- User story seed: As a household member, I need route and perimeter context so I can understand options without mistaking the app for an official command source.
- Data / logic notes: Route status, hazard perimeter source, timestamp, confidence/source labeling, and cached map behavior are required.
- Open questions: Which data sources provide hazard perimeter and route status in MVP?
- Source: App screen decisions and design system.

### 2026-05-01 - Verified Info Escalation and Chat Hierarchy

- Product rule: Private groups should be able to push verified information to a larger community info aggregator when the information is useful beyond the group.
- User story seed: As a group member who sees a sudden road closure, dangerous creek crossing, or downed tree, I need a way to escalate verified local information from my trusted group to the wider community so others can avoid danger.
- Data / logic notes: Requires a hierarchy between private group chat, verified group reports, and a community-level aggregator. Escalated items need source group, reporter, verification status, timestamp, location, category, and visibility scope.
- Data / logic notes: Likely report categories include road closure, creek crossing, downed tree, blocked route, utility hazard, animal/livestock issue, shelter/resource, and official update reference.
- Open questions: Who can verify before escalation: group mods, multiple group members, emergency partners, or community moderators?
- Open questions: How should the UX prevent noisy chat messages from flooding the community aggregator?
- Source: `devlog` discussion on private-to-community information flow.

### 2026-05-01 - Leadership Succession and Role Acknowledgement

- Product rule: Groups need a chain of succession for mods/leaders when primary leaders do not respond during an incident.
- User story seed: As a group member in an active incident, I need the app to identify an available leader if the current mod is offline, unsafe, or on the move, so coordination does not stall.
- Data / logic notes: Succession should notify users based on status and role. A user inheriting lead must actively accept and acknowledge they can fill the role, or mark `not safe` / `on the move` so the app can skip them and notify the next eligible user.
- Data / logic notes: If a user has no network connection or does not respond within the incident time window, the app should mark them as `not online` for succession purposes.
- Data / logic notes: A static phase at the beginning of an incident or defined time window may be needed to prevent leadership from bouncing too rapidly between users.
- Open questions: What timeout determines non-response? Should timeout vary by incident severity, group size, or role priority?
- Open questions: Which roles are eligible for succession, and can users opt out before an incident?
- Source: `devlog` discussion on chain of succession and active-user role handling.

## 2026-07-23 - Temporal Access Control Layer for Household Profiles
- **Context**: Solo founder product decision to implement a time-bounded permission engine for sensitive household details (e.g., door codes, access tokens, lockboxes, pet data).
- **Core Requirements**:
  - Expose explicit sharing triggers in two core UI layouts: the active Assistance Request workflow and directly on a target User Profile details card.
  - All shared credentials must bind to a specific expiration timestamp natively (`1-day` default, `1-week`, or user-defined custom duration).
- **Technical Enforcement**: The underlying data layer must automatically expire the temporary access token once the system clock passes the duration timestamp, immediately re-masking the data fields for the receiving user.

### 2026-07-23 - Full 4-Phase Resilience Lifecycle MVP Scope

- **Product rule**: The baseline MVP will include all 4 phases of the resilience lifecycle: Peace Time, Call To Arms, War Time, and Rebuild. This overrides the previous "emergency-only" scope limit (`devlog`).
- **User story seed**: As a community member, I need resource sharing during Peace Time and recovery tracking during Rebuild so the app remains valuable outside of active fire or flood windows.
- **Data / logic notes**: App architecture must support state transitions between phases at both the household and group levels, tracking separate UI states and feature permissions based on the active phase.
- **Open questions**: What automation triggers the shift from Peace Time to Call To Arms on a community scale, and who has the authority to declare the transition?
- **Source**: Solo founder architectural directive.
